            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">It comes down to chemistry. The virus itself if is made up of genetic material wrapped in a fatty coating. Soap molecules can disrupt this lipid membrane, causing it to fall apart. The virus’ “spike” proteins, which normally help it to invade
                human cells, are lost into the surrounding environment rendering the virus inactive. With the fragments of the virus enveloped by the soap molecules, these are then washed away when you rinse your hands.<br> The physical action of scrubbing
                your hands can also help to dislodge viral particles, which is why there has been so much emphasis on how we wash our hands and how long for. It does not matter how good your soap is if you do not apply it thoroughly enough</p>
